# Eragon 
## by Christopher Paolini
### One of the first fantasy novels I've read. This is the one that really captivated my endearment towards writing and worldbuilding. I love the integration of magic, the complex development of characters, and both sense of scale. It remains an enjoyable revisit to this day and has earned its signature spot at the center of my bookshelf.
